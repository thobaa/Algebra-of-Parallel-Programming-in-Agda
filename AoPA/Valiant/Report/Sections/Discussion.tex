Some future work:
Expand on the algebraic structures in Agda, perhaps useful to learn abstract algebra (proving that zero in a ring annihilates is a fun(!) exercise!). Also expand on it so that it becomes closer to what is doable in algebra packages -- create groups by generators and equations, for example.

Fit into Algebra of Programming (maybe).
