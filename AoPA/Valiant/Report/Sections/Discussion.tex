Some future work:
Fit into Algebra of Programming (maybe).

Points: (for introduction too)
\begin{itemize}
\item give a different (more natural) specification of parsing / transitive closure and prove that it is equivalent and easy to prove that valiant's (simplified) is correct 
\item AOP (A)
\item structure of datatypes is important. use records as a kind of interface. example with adding empty or removing sing.
\end{itemize}
