% questions to answer: what are we doing? Why are we doing it?
\subsection{What?}
In this thesis, we use the programming language Agda to formalize enough matrix algebra to formally prove the correctness of Valiant's algorithm for computing the transitive closure of a matrix.

% begin by
We begin by giving a short introduction to Agda, where we use it to define and prove the correctness of a maximum function on lists. Then we introduce the algebra relevant for parsing (some parts of which are fairly non-standard, in particular, we need to consider non-associative multiplication). We give definitions of algebraic structures both as ``mathematical'' definitions (as seen in an algebra textbook) and as Agda definitions to display the similarity between Agda syntax and ordinary mathematics, and to provide the base for later chapters. The main algebraic structures we discuss are commutative monoids and nonassociative semirings. We also define matrices over the nonassociative semirings. Next, we give a short introduction to Parsing, mainly to relate it to the algebra we have just presented, and show that Parsing is equivalent to computing the transitive closure of an upper triangular matrix. In the final part of our thesis, we first present Valiant's algorithm and implement it in Agda, and then we combine the algebra with the ideas in the parsing section to prove the correctness of the algorithm.

The thesis is meant to be usable as an introduction to proving things in Agda for people not familiar with the programming language, but it is helpful to have some previous experience with either functional programming or abstract algebra.
