\begin{abstract}\todo{expand ABSTRACT a bit!}
Parsing is an important problem with applications ranging from compilers to bioinformatics. To perform the parsing more quickly, it would be desirable to be able to parse in parallel. Valiant's algorithm \cite{Valiant} is a divide and conquer algorithm for parsing and can be used to perform a large part of the work in parallel. It is fairly easy to implement in a functional programming languages, using pattern matching. Agda is a dependently typed functional programming language that doubles as a proof assistant and is hence very suitable for proving implementing and proving the correctness of Valiant's algorithm. 

In this thesis, we provide a specification for the parsing problem and prove that it is equivalent to the specification of the transitive closure used in \cite{Valiant}. We compare the two specifications and use our specification to derive Valiant's algorithm. We then implement it in Agda and prove our implementation correct (according to our specification).

We also give short introductions to parsing, programming and proving with Agda and to using algebraic structures in Agda.

\section*{Acknowledgements}
I would like to thank my supervisor Jean-Phillipe Bernardy and my examiner Patrik Jansson for their support, patience and optimism during the creation of this master's thesis.

I would also like to thank Anders Martinsson for listening to me failing to explain what parsing is on three separate occasions.\\[1cm]
