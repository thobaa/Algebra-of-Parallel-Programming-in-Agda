080602: Testing --type-in-type

  Testing --type-in-type as a work-around for the lack of universe
  polymorphism in Agda.

  I copied the modules Sets.agda and Relations.agda, added the
  --type-in-type flag and removed all code duplication. It seems to
  work as expected, but if we apply this transformation there is no
  (easy) way back.
